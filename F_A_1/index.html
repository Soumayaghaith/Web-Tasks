                <td>As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the study of celestial bodies by applying the laws
                    of
                    physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular
                    physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book unfolds the innovative aspects of
                    astrophysics,
                    which will be crucial for the holistic understanding of the subject matter.</td>

                    Are we alone in the Universe? Was there anything before the Big Bang? Are there other universes?
                    What makes stars shine? Where does Earth's water come from? Why is the night sky dark? Was there
                    ever life on Mars? How do telescopes work? This engaging guide book answers all these questions and
                    hundreds more.

                    This second edition of Introduction to Cosmology is an exciting update of an award-winning textbook.
                    It
                    explains modern cosmological concepts, such as dark energy, in the context of the Big Bang theory.
                    Its
                    clear, lucid writing style, with a wealth of useful everyday analogies, makes it exceptionally
                    engaging.

                    engineering
                    and natural sciences. This book provides an up-to-date interdisciplinary geoscience-focused overview
                    of
                    solid solar system bodies and their evolution, based on the comparative description of processes

                    In writing this textbook the author's objective was to provide students with a non-trivial,
                    reasonably priced introduction to astronomy. Starting with problems astronomers face on Barth
                    connected with observation, the book then moves on to cover the Solar System, galaxies and finally
                    cosmology.
